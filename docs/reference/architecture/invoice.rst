Invoice
=======

`Invoices` are generated based on an `Order`. However, they're not linked to it, as you can see in the class diagram below:

.. image:: ../../images/dcEntities.svg

You can generate an `Order's invoice` from the admin `Order` edit page. The `Invoice` can also be generated by the `Customer` once the payment is successful. We'll check for existing invoices with same order reference before trying to generate the invoice.

Beware, the relation is not explicitly set in database; there is no explicit link between an `Invoice` and an `Order` (this is a design choice, in order to be able to generate invoices from several orders for instance, or several invoices for one order, and so on). Our implementation makes a link through the reference, but it's only a default behavior.

Invoice Statuses
================

The various statuses for the `Invoice` are as follows:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    // ...

    interface InvoiceInterface
    {
        const STATUS_OPEN     = 0; // created but not paid
        const STATUS_PAID     = 1; // the invoice has been paid
        const STATUS_CONFLICT = 2; // there is a conflict about this invoice

Feel free to add your own statuses in your implementations; but remember to override the corresponding ``getStatusList`` static method.
