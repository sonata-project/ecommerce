    single: Payment; Debug

===================
Debug payment setup
===================

Presentation
============

Debug Payment simulates the bank for your testing purpose. The ``sendbank`` will redirect you to a page where you can act as the bank and choose the action you want (accept or refuse the payment).

Then, ``DebugPayment`` will call itself over HTTP (it needs to be self-reachable through its URL) and process the payment or not.

For security reasons, this method is only available in dev environment.

Configuration
=============
