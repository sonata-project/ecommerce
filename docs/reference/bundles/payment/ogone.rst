Presentation
============

Ogone is a CreditCard payment provider. Here's how to configure it in order to use it in your application.

Configuration
=============

Here's how to configure Ogone for Sonata e-commerce:

1. Go to the Ogone configuration portal:
    1. ``Technical Settings`` -> ``Global Security Parameters`` ; set ``Hash Algorithm`` to ``SHA-1``
    2. ``Technical Settings`` -> ``Data and origin verification`` ; add your various domain(s) URL(s) separated by ';' (no spaces)
    3. ``Technical Settings`` -> ``Data and origin verification`` ; fill in your SHA-IN pass phrase (keep it, you'll need it for your app config)
    4. ``Technical Settings`` -> ``Transaction feedback``
        1. ``HTTP redirection in the browser`` : leave all fields blank
        2. ``Direct HTTP server-to-server request`` : ``Timing of the request`` : ``always deferred``
            URL of the merchant's post-payment page
                1. If the payment's status is "accepted", "on hold" or "uncertain" -> ``{your_host}/payment/callback``
                2. If the payment's status is "cancelled by the client" or "too many rejections by the acquirer". -> ``{your_host}/payment/error``
        3. ``SHA-OUT pass phrase`` ; fill in with the same key as the one you've given for the SHA-IN


2. Configure the payment gateway according to the values you'll get with your Ogone account (or you'll fill in the Ogone admin)
