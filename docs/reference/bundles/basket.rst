Presentation
============

The BasketBundle handles everything related to the Basket and the Order process (user workflow).
It offers Basket, Address, Payment & Shipping forms, all the needed controller actions, and exposes Basket's handling services such as Provider, Factory and Loader.

Several actions are provided by the controller:

* ``index``: (step 1) Displays the current status of the Basket and its update form (where you can delete elements or update their quantity)
* ``update``: Validates the submitted update basket form
* ``reset``: Empties the basket
* ``addProduct``: As the name says, handles the add product to basket form submission
* ``deliveryAddressStep``: (step 2) renders the delivery address form and handles its submission (the user needs to be authenticated)
* ``deliveryStep``: (step 3) renders the delivery method (shipping) selection form and handles its submission
* ``paymentStep``: (step 4) renders the payment method selection form and handles its submission
* ``finalReviewStep``: (step 5) renders the basket status before payment, terms & conditions acceptance form and handles its submission
* ``headerPreview``: Renders the preview of the basket (to put in a header)
* ``authenticationStep``: Retrieves the customer related to the logged in user and links it to the basket ; this will redirect to the authentication form if the user is not logged in.

There are two ways to deal with Basket storage:

* Session storage (default)
* DB storage

To enable DB storage, you'll need to change the following configuration values:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sonata_basket:
        # ...
        factory: sonata.basket.entity.factory     # This is where you switch to DB stored Basket ; sonata.basket.session.factory for session
        # ...


    # Enable Doctrine to map the provided entities
    doctrine:
        orm:
            entity_managers:
                default:
                    mappings:
                        ApplicationSonataBasketBundle: ~
                        SonataBasketBundle: ~

Please note that if you don't do so, you won't be able to retrieve a user's basket if he loggs in from a different computer. Default factory is set to session factory.

Configuration
=============

Here's the full default configuration for SonataBasketBundle:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sonata_basket:

        # Services
        builder:            sonata.basket.builder.standard
        factory:            sonata.basket.session.factory
        loader:             sonata.basket.loader.standard

        # Model
        class:
            basket:         Application\Sonata\BasketBundle\Entity\Basket
            basket_element: Application\Sonata\BasketBundle\Entity\BasketElement
            customer:       Application\Sonata\CustomerBundle\Entity\Customer

        # Forms
        basket:
            form:
                type:       sonata_basket_basket
                name:       sonata_basket_basket_form
        shipping:
            form:
                type:       sonata_basket_shipping
                name:       sonata_basket_shipping_form
        payment:
            form:
                type:       sonata_basket_payment
                name:       sonata_basket_payment_form


As you can see, you can override the builder, factory & loader services ; basket, basket_element & customer classes and the various forms.
Moreover, you're able to override the rest of the bundle by extending it (through SonataEasyExtendsBundle for instance).
